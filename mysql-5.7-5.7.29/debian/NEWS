mysql-5.7 (5.7.12-1~exp1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Password behaviour when the MySQL root password is empty has
    changed. Packaging now enables socket authentication when the MySQL
    root password is empty. This means that a non-root user can't log in
    as the MySQL root user with an empty password. The new logic is as
    follows:

    - The auth_socket plugin will be installed automatically only if it
      is to be activated for the root user.

    - The auth_socket plugin will be activated for the root user:

      + If you had a database before with an empty root password.

      + If you create a new database with an empty root password.

    - The auth_socket plugin will NOT be activated for the root user:

      + If you had a database before with a root password set.

      + If you create a new database with a root password set.

    - The auth_socket plugin will NOT be activated for any other user.

    - If you do not want the new behaviour, set the MySQL root password
      to be non-empty.

  * The MySQL server now uses strict mode by default. See
    http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html#sql-mode-strict
    for details. See
    http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/sql-mode.html#sql-mode-setting
    for details about the default settings in older versions.
